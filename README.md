# NoLib
A powerful JS Library used by NoSpam to Hook &amp; other Stuff
NOTE: Due to NoSpam being closed-source, this is just a Limited but still cool Version of the NoLib.

> Use it for :
- Code quicker
- Have detailer Errors
- Better Performance Code
- Tons of "More" Strings..

> How to start?
- Tbh i don't care where you do start..Clone dis and Include it in your Code by Importing it 
( ever heard of import NoLib from 'NoLib.js'?! )

> I want to contribute, i like this project!
- Idfc, this is MINE. Joking. If you want you can DM me on Discord, sooner or later i'll answer.

> Will this Lib make my Bot reach NoSpam's Level?
- As long as you're using, definitely NO. This is a Library to simply your Coding experience, but tbh it's only used by NoSpam to have faster processes. So, do not start dreaming of you as a cool dev, that's me, not you, bro.

> Ok, where tf is NoLib documentation?
- Idk, i don't have enough time to build one atm, sorry.

> How do it Hook my Bot Processes?
- Just make another .js file to Hook 'em, those kinda functions are NoLib's Built-In
